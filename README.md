AI-Powered Legal Contract Analyzer
An intelligent system developed by CothonSolutions for analyzing legal contracts using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). This web-based tool automates the extraction of key clauses, identifies risky or unusual clauses, generates plain-English summaries, and provides an interactive dashboard for legal and business professionals.
Features

Text Extraction: Extracts text from PDF and DOCX documents using pdfplumber and docx2txt.
Clause Extraction: Identifies key clauses (e.g., indemnity, confidentiality, governing law) using SpaCy’s Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Risk Classification: Classifies clauses as risky or unusual using machine learning models trained with Scikit-learn.
Contract Summarization: Generates plain-English summaries using HuggingFace’s Legal-BERT.
Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes analysis results with Streamlit and Plotly/Matplotlib.
Data Storage: Stores extracted data in SQLite and manipulates it with Pandas/JSON.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/cothonsolutions/legal-contract-analyzer.git
cd legal-contract-analyzer


Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Install SpaCy model:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


Download required NLTK data:
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger'); nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker'); nltk.download('words')"



Usage

Start the Streamlit application:
streamlit run src/main.py


Access the web interface:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 (or the URL shown in the terminal).
Upload a contract document (PDF or DOCX).
View the extracted clauses, risk analysis, summary, and interactive dashboard.
